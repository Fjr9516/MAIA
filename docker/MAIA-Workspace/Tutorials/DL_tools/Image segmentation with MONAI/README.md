# Image segmentation with PyTorch and MONAI

## Introduction
This tutorial/lab is designed to introduce you to the concepts of medical image segmentation and the U-Net architecture. You will also get hands-on experience with training a U-Net model using PyTorch and MONAI.

## Tutorial structure
The tutorial is divided into three parts:

1. **Part 1: Introduction to Segmentation and U-Net:** [Segmentation and UNET](Segmentation%20and%20UNET.ipynb)
2. **Part 2: Visualizing attention maps:** [Attention Maps](Attention%20maps.ipynb)
3. **Part 3: Training a U-Net model with MONAI:** [MONAI](MONAI.ipynb)

The lab requires you to code some part in python files, you can use the VSCode IDE on JupyterHub to do so more conveniently.
